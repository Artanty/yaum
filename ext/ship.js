/**
 * Ships the extension log to the backend (POST /api/library/ext-logs).
 *
 * Why: the buffer in log.js persists across popup closes but not across machines, profiles or
 * reboots, and it is not greppable. The backend already keeps rotated JSON logs and can be read
 * over HTTP, so pushing the trace there is what makes "the extension said nothing" a claim you can
 * check rather than take on trust.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate file loaded only in the popup, NOT inside log.js: log.js is also a
 * content script, and shipping from there would POST an identical batch once per frame.
 *
 * Designed around the failure mode a logging feature is most prone to — becoming the noise:
 *  - only unshipped entries are sent, and they are marked shipped only after the server accepts
 *  - one in-flight request at a time; extra calls are no-ops, not a queue of requests
 *  - backoff 5s → 15s → 60s → 5min, then it stops for good, so a backend that is down cannot turn
 *    into an endless stream of "shipping failed" entries (which would themselves be shipped)
 *  - its own diagnostics stay at debug level; only a change in backoff step is worth a warn
 *  - never throws into the caller, and never blocks the popup
